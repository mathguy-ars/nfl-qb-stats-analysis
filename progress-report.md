My initial project proposal was a tad overzealous as I am both excited about Drake Maye and eager to highlight his success thus far in the 2025 season. I have been able to narrow down my approach to comparing his season statistics to that of the league. I have considered both a random sampling of starters in the nfl as well as the current top 5 quarterbacks. This was I can compare how Drake Maye has been playing relative to others in the league. But what does it mean to do better or worse than another quarterback? The dataframe consists of several key statistics used by the league and the media to illustrate the effectiveness of the quarterback’s performance. 
 
We start with the idea of quarterback data to build the dataframe. The primary metrics of quarterback play are pass attempts, completions, and touchdown passes. The secondary consideration is total yards. It is important to draw this distinction between the primary components and the secondary component. Yardage is a latent result of a completed pass attempt. The accumulated yardage totals tell the story of the receivers performance more than that of the quarterback. A quarterback’s main job is to attempt to pass the ball in such a way that the receiver can catch it. What the receiver is able to do upon completing the catch is not very telling of a quarterback’s efficiency. How many times did they throw it? How many of those throws were productive?  

Some challenges I faced when considering the dataframe included limited nfl data for the subject of the project, Mr. Drake Maye, an official/unofficial nfl stats python database, and too much irrelevant data to sort through. Narrowing the scope down to this current season saved a lot of runtime resources. I could not get the nfl database to load in anything less than 15 minutes. This made re-running the code an arduous task and far too time consuming. After struggling with technical problems such as the one mentioned above, it became evident that I was swinging for too high of a fence. I realized I  had to reign in my enthusiasm for the project and approach it from a more practical standpoint. I am doing this project because Drake Maye is good. So why not compare him to other good quarterbacks? He is statistically near the top of the league so it would be best to compare him to some other quarterbacks and then skip over to the best quarterbacks in the league to see if he is deserving of being in their company. 

My reformulation of the project overview has produced three critical questions that will be answered within the project. One, how accurate is Drake Maye compared to other quarterbacks and the top 5 quarterbacks? Two, how efficient is Drake Maye as a passer in terms of yards gained per attempt? Three, how does Drake Maye perform in terms of scoring, compared to other quarterbacks and the top 5?

The data will be collected via web pages which regularly publish football statistics. I will check the nfl website and then confirm the data using Pro Football Reference. I do not plan on having to clean the data so no further action will be needed in that regard. Instead I will scrape the categories for each player simultaneously and make sure they are current through week 13. At the time of writing this some teams have already played for week 14 so I will have to subtract those stats from the player totals. 

Analysis will include scatter type plots and bar charts. The code will be as simple and lightweight as i can make it using some of the techniques we have learned in class thus far. I have a very modular flow planned for the notebook and the code will be well documented and well commented.
