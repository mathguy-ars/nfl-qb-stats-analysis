NFL QB Stats Analysis

Project Summary

This project provides a comparative analysis of Drake Maye’s passing performance using a small dataset of other quarterbacks as well as the current top 5 quarterbacks in the league. All statistics and comparisons are through the first 13 weeks of the 2025 season. The goal is to evaluate Drake Maye on key metrics and understand how he stacks up against both his peers and the league’s leading passers.

The analysis focuses on simple but meaningful measures of quarterback performance, including Completion Percentage, Yards per Attempt (YPA), and Touchdowns. These metrics provide insight into passing accuracy, efficiency, and scoring ability.

By examining both a smaller group of other quarterbacks and a top‑5 leaderboard, the project answers questions about Drake Maye’s relative strengths and weaknesses in a clear, interpretable way.

Key Questions Answered

How accurate is Drake Maye compared to other quarterbacks and the top 5 quarterbacks?
Completion percentage is used to measure passing accuracy and reliability. This metric allows for a straightforward comparison of Drake Maye against both peer quarterbacks and the top performers in the league.

How efficient is Drake Maye as a passer in terms of yards gained per attempt?
Yards per Attempt (YPA) is calculated for each quarterback, providing insight into how productive each throw is. Comparing YPA across quarterbacks highlights whether Drake Maye gains more or fewer yards per passing attempt relative to others.

How does Drake Maye perform in terms of scoring, compared to other quarterbacks and the top 5?
Touchdowns are analyzed both in total and relative to passing attempts or completions. This measure indicates Drake Maye’s ability to generate points and helps contextualize his effectiveness in scoring situations.
