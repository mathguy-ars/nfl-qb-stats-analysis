  I am both excited about Drake Maye and eager to highlight his success thus far in the 2025 season.  The best way to do this is to compare his season statistics to that of the league. I had considered a random sampling of starters in the nfl as well as the current top 5 quarterbacks. This way I could compare how Drake Maye has been playing relative to others in the league. But what does it mean to do better or worse than another quarterback? The dataframe consists of several key statistics used by the league and the media to illustrate the effectiveness of the quarterback’s performance. Ultimately, I decided that a smaller dataframe would make the statistics appear too convenient or cherry picked. I expanded the frame by including all quarterbacks with a minimum of 10 starts during the season. This gives a much clearer picture of Maye’s performance against other qualifying quarterbacks. The biggest benefit of this decision is that it compared him to over 25 other quarterbacks and therefore provided a more complete outlook on his performance via increased sample size. The 14 week window ensures all qualifying players have played through their bye week which prevents uneven recording of statistics. The one caveat is that football can be a violent game and missing games due to injury is common. Using players who have started at least 10 games is a best effort to mitigate any skewed statistics caused by lack of gameplay. These decisions carved out the scope of the topic

  The project overview contains four critical questions that will be answered within the project. One, how accurate is Drake Maye compared to other quarterbacks and the top 5 quarterbacks? Two, how efficient is Drake Maye as a passer in terms of yards gained per attempt? Three, how does Drake Maye perform in terms of scoring, compared to other quarterbacks and the top 5? Four, how does Drake Maye’s passer rating statistic compare to other quarterbacks in the league?

It would not have been any more helpful to use the 2024 season sample for my project because Drake Maye didn’t become the starter until later in the season. Given these particular hurdles, I felt this year’s statlines were the most useful.

  We start with the idea of quarterback data to build the dataframe. The primary metrics of quarterback play are pass attempts, completions, and touchdown passes. The secondary consideration is total yards. It is important to draw this distinction between the primary components and the secondary components. Yardage is a latent result of a completed pass attempt. The accumulated yardage totals tell the story of the receivers performance more than that of the quarterback. A quarterback’s main job is to attempt to pass the ball in such a way that the receiver can catch it. What the receiver is able to do upon completing the catch is not very telling of a quarterback’s efficiency. How many times did they throw it? How many of those throws were productive?  The percentage of productive throws, meaning, throws that were caught by the receiver, versus total number of passes is what makes up the completion percentage statistic. This is a very important stat for any quarterback with virtually any sample size of pass attempts. It describes the percentage of times a quarterback is successful in their main job. This data doubles as an opportunity to calculate some other metrics in python. Calculated figures include YPA (average yards per throw/attempt) and Td_per_att (average touchdowns per throw/attempt).

  The NFL uses a composite statistic called “Passer Rating” to exhibit a quarterback’s productivity throughout the course of a drive, game, or season depending on the sample. This stat is useful because it puts their data through a formulaic function which then outputs number 0-158.8. The higher a quarterback’s passer rating, the better their performance. While this statistic is not nearly as objective as something like wins or losses, it does tell a story of how the quarterback themself fared in the game. Football is a game of many moving parts and each of the 22 players on the field have their own assigned tasks. So it is difficult to say a team win or loss is strictly based on quarterback play. This project is about quarterbacks in particular so I thought the stat would be useful and made a function which can accurately calculate the statistic based on the official formula. That function can be found near the top of the Collab document.

  I created a fictitious player named Double Jasper. The intention behind doing so was to create a player with nearly perfect performance stats in order to compare each player to the ultimate rendition of the position. This helps compare a current players production to that of the ideal quarterback. I feel it is helpful for visual digestion of the metrics that are displayed in the notebook’s visualizations. I also added Josh Allen to random sampling of quarterbacks because not every quarterback starting that week had enough stats. Josh Allen is a player with good stats but he didnt make the top 5 so I felt it was appropriate to include him here to normalize those stats a bit.

  The data was collected via web pages which regularly publish football statistics. I will check the nfl website and then confirm the data using Pro Football Reference. Analysis will include scatter type plots and bar charts.

  Some challenges I faced when considering the dataframe included limited access nfl data for the subject of the project, Mr. Drake Maye, an official/unofficial nfl stats python database, and too much irrelevant data to sort through. Narrowing the scope down to this current season saved a lot of runtime resources. I could not get the nfl database to load in anything less than 15 minutes. This made re-running the code an arduous task and far too time consuming. After struggling with technical problems such as the one mentioned above, it became evident that I was swinging for too high of a fence. I reduced the dataframe to a smaller subset of players: quarterbacks. 

  There was also the challenge of cleaning csv data. My original code was unable to account for extra whitespaces in the comma separated values. It also produces too many “NaN” results since the attributes in each csv were slightly different. I was able to use some regex to clean the data and in some cases I opted to force python to read the data in a certain way and ignore other “white noise” type situations. Finally, I chose to hide dataframe tables that were outputting ugly data or error messages. Sometimes, the best way to avoid errors or undesirable results is to remove them from the equation entirely.

  The code is as simple and lightweight as I could make it using some of the techniques we have learned in class thus far. I have a very modular flow in the notebook and the code is both well documented and commented via employing the use of docstrings and standard inline comments explaining what each line of code is doing. The matplotlib package did all of the heavy lifting with the visualizations.

  If I had more time for this project I would wait a few years to put together a much healthier sample size for Maye. This would allow me to compare him to some all time greats. It would also enable me to examine any regressions he has in future seasons. He is too early in his career to evaluate the overall body of work. Perhaps in 10-15 years.

  To summarize my findings, Drake Maye is very deserving of being in the season’s best quarterbacks conversation. His total number of touchdowns puts him in the top handful of quarterbacks this season. His low interception total indicates that he is generally finishing drives in the most fruitful ways possible whether the drive ends with a field goal, touchdown, or punt. It is critical for quarterbacks to retain the ball until one of these three true outcomes is achieved. Mathew Stafford, a veteran player, has thrown more touchdowns as has Dak Prescott. But more touchdowns does not necessarily always translate to more wins. The Patriots have amassed 11 wins in 13 games played. Drake Maye is a huge reason why they have been so successful this year.
